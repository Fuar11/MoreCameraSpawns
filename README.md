# More Camera Spawns

A gameplay mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

It adds new spawns around Lower Great Bear for the instant camera. 

There is 1 guaranteed spawn and several lower chance spawns across Mystery Lake, Coastal Highway, Mountain Town, Broken Railroad, Ash Canyon, etc... More spawns may be added in the future.

If you already have the camera, the spawns will not be there (they will disappear).
